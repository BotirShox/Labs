B<MAIN MENU> 

This help screen may be scrolled by  KEY_UP (CONTROL-K), KEY_DOWN 
(CONTROL-N), PAGE_UP (CONTROL-P) and PAGE_DOWN (CONTORL-V). 

This is an interactive tool to edit the input files used by the 
B<FPLO>-package. It opens a quick way for changing values and 
options. 

For command line options type U<fedit -h>

=H1 General remarks 
 
B<Fedit> is designed with the help of the UNIX specific library 
U<curses> (or U<ncurses> on Linux systmes). This gives a certain amount of 
portability to various terminals. It works best with U<xterm>, U<hpterm>, 
U<dtterm>, U<linux>. It also works on U<vt100> and U<vt220>. If you have a 
terminal which is not supported by U<curses> (error message: can not 
open terminal (or similar)) set the environment variable to some of 
the above mentioned terminals, i.e. U<vt220> and try again. May be then
some function keys, like LEFT, RIGHT and PAGE_UP ...  are not well 
defined.  Use control keys instead.

This tool knows about the B<fplo>-version, it is designed for.
If you apply this tool to an older version of the input files,
some data may be missing. Therefore, B<fedit> will try to run B<fplo>
in order to update the input files. This should work if the installation
is correct. It is not possible to downgrad input files in this way,
due to the possibility of data loss. If you really want to use old
B<fplo> versions with newer files, you should backup the calculation
and downgrad the input files by hand (edit the version number) or
use B<fdowngrad.pl>.
 
=H1 Problems 
 
The communication of B<fedit> with the input files is managed via 
screen definitions (in the file U<+fedit>). This file is deleted
and recreated on each start of B<fedit>.
Most of the work is done in a temporary directory (U<+tmp>) which is created 
when B<fedit> starts. In case the directory creation fails make sure 
that the file permissions are appropriate.
B<fedit> calls B<fplo> to perform various input file updates. If the
executable (the default B<fplo> or the one, specified via 
command line option U<fedit -p EXECUTABLE> ) is not in the PATH
or does not run correctly, B<fedit> may come back with an error 
message, stating that U<+fedit> is not found. In such cases, please 
check if the B<fplo>-executable is running correctly!
 
=H1 Keys 
 
This is the list of all keys and their functionality.
 
=H2 CONTROL-C
Abort B<fedit>, discarding all changes. 
=H2 CONTROL-R 
Refresh screen 
=H2 CONTROL-W or /
Search content (and start data editing). see B<Usage>
=H2 SPACE 
Activate the alternative menus at the bottom of the screen. 
If the alternative menu contains the entry U<[...]> the next part of
the menu is shown on subsequent SPACE key press.
While editing data, SPACE is simply a character. 
=H2 ALPHANUMERIC KEYS AND (+), (-) 
Acting as hotkeys, or while editing data, as simple characters.
=H2 COMMA (,) 
is a repetition indicator, when  editing data. 
The comma is expanded to the string just before it: 
1.3,,  or 1.3 , , means 1.3 1.3 1.3 
1.1,1.2 means 1.1 1.1 1.2 
=H1 
The following function keys may work differently at different 
terminals. For that reason  U<emacs>-style control-keys are supplied. 
At least these should work in some way. 
 
=H2 KEY_LEFT or CONTROL-B, KEY_RIGHT or CONTROL-F 
move the cursor in the fields while editing 
=H2 KEY_UP or CONTROL-K, KEY_DOWN or CONTROL-N 
scroll the screen a line up or down

delete the character at or before the cursor position. 
=H2 KEY_HOME or CONTROL-A 
move to beginning of the field 
=H2 KEY_END or CONTROL-E 
move to the end of the field 
=H2 PAGE_UP or CONTROL-P

=H2 ESC ESC (two times pressed) 
exit edit or search actions, discarding all changes 
=H2 ENTER 
accept and finish editing
or select a data item for editing, when in search mode
 
=H1 Usage 
 
B<fedit> is a collection of screens/forms with editable fields. 
The screens are scrollable. Scrolling is done with KEY_UP, 
KEY_DOWN, PAGE-UP, PAGE_DOWN. If there is an invisible part of the 
forms it is marked by B<[...]> above or below the forms. 
Each field can be activated by a hotkey. Each active key is marked 
by (X), X being an ordinary key. If a colored terminal is available
the hotkeys are colored. Typing a hotkey, will start a data edit action,
,execute a function, switch to a submenu or show the alternative menu bar.
If the screen position of the data field is not currently visible,
the screen is scrolled to make it visible.

There are two kinds of hotkeys: 
=H+ simple keys like 'B<e>', 'B<3>' or SPACE 
    and compound keys 
=H-
The compound keys occur if i.e. some fields have automatic numbering 
as hotkeys. All numbers greater than 9 consist of at least two digits. 
The hotkey will be the sequence of these digits. 
There may be other compound hotkeys.

If the first key is typed the first data item below the current (internal) 
screen position is selected, which has a compound hotkey starting with 
the typed key. 
Now, you may continue to type the next key. After each key press 
the current position jumps to the next item having a hotkey starting 
with the sequence typed allready. If the key sequence, allready typed, 
is uniqe among all screen items, the editing starts. If not, the next 
key may be typed, or the TAB key may be used to cycle through all 
items fiting into the current key sequence.
If the current sequence does not uniqely identify a single item, you
have to select the item, typing ENTER. 
Again: TAB cycles through the set of possible items, ENTER starts editing.
As soon as the typed key sequence does not correspond any more to
a possible compound hotkey on the screen, the hotkey selection process
will abort. Another possibility to abort the hotkey selection is ESC-ESC
or any function key except ENTER.
Example: try to select the spacegroups 2,22,27,223! Its easy.

SPACE has a special meaning. It is active if the symbol B<[]> 
appears in the left corner of the menu bar. SPACE opens the alternative 
menu, which adds additional submenus and functions. 

 
There are some classes of editable fields: 
=H2 boolean switches (t,f) 
are simply toggled by typing the hotkey. 
=H2 binary switches  (1,2) 
are simply toggled by typing the hotkey. 
=H2 select boxes 
the hotkeys change the selected data, marked by [*]. 
=H2 check boxes 
the hotkeys toggle the options 
=H2 editable fields 
these fields may be edited with the function keys explaind above. 
A field may freely be edited until B<ENTER> or B<ESC-ESC> is 
pressed. 
If the first key stroke is an insert character, the string is 
deleted and the field contains only this character: continue editing. 
If any cursor movement or delete action is done, the editing starts
with the current string. 
B<ENTER>: leave edit-mode and take changes. 
If the new data value is invalid, an error message is shown in the 
status-line and the edit-mode is reactivated, until the value is valid
or B<ESC-ESC> is pressed. 
B<ESC-ESC>: leave edit-mode and restore old value 
=H2 BASIS edit fields 
these fields are explaind below, here the action of the keys is 
restricted, to enforce valid data values. 
=H2 connected fields 
These are editable fields, which are activated by the same hotkey. 
After leaving the first field the editing continues with the next data 
field.

=H2 Searching
When CONTROL-W or / is press the search utility is called and an 
editable field appears in the status line. Enter the search string.
While you type, the screen will scroll to the next position matching 
the current search string. If no more lines below the current position
match the string, the search may be continued at the top of the screen, 
typing TAB or CONTROL-W. These keys cycle through occurances of the 
search string.
As long as the search is active you may complete or edit the search 
string using BACKSPACE or cursor keys. ESC-ESC and all function keys 
which have no meaning in lineediting will cancel the search.
If the search is used in screens with data items, you may press ENTER
if the desired data item is selected. This will start the data editing
or just toggle the data value (if the data item is binary). To cancel 
search without edit effects use ESC-ESC or other function keys.
The next time you press CONTROL-W or / the previous search string is 
default. If you want to take it, just press CONTROL-W or TAB again. 
Otherwise, type a new string or edit the current one. 

 
=H1 Menu bar 
 
The menu bar contains the following entries 
 
=H2 [] 
SPACE will call the alternative menu.
=H2 extern edit (Expert mode)
Call the external editor.  This is strongly discouraged.
=H2 Quit/save 
This leaves the tool. The files U<=.in>, U<=.basis> and U<=.sym> are saved.
You will be prompted for saving the files. 
If you type 'y' the files are saved.
If you type 'n' all changes are discarded.
If you type ESC-ESC B<fedit> continues.
=H2 Exit/discard (Expert mode) 
Exit B<fedit> without saving. 
=H2 Symmetry 
Call the B<SYMMETRY MENU>.
This is the first action to do, if input-files for a new structure
have to be created. 
=H2 Basis
Call the B<BASIS DEFINITION> menu.
Here the basis orbitals are defined.
=H2 Help 
In the help screens the scrolling is possible with keys explaind above. 
Additionally a search function is available via CONTROL-W. 
 
=H1 Status line 
 
At the bottom of the screen a status line is visible. It provides 
information about the success of the operations done. Non-critical 
error messages are displayed there. 
Have an eye on it!
 
=H1 Alternative menu 
 
The alternative menu is activated with SPACE. The next key after space 
may be one of the menu entry hotkeys or again SPACE, if the menu 
continous (symbol U<[...]>)  or any other key (which closes the 
menu).
 

=H2 Bandplot
This submenu contains all data for the creation of the bandstructure. 
=H2 CPA 
This submenu contains all data connected to a disorder calculation. 
It is meaningful only if disordered structur input is detected or 
if the B<OPTION BEB> is set. 
=H2 LSDA+U
=H2 Shape
This settings control the shape function creation and application.
=H2 Mesh
Settings for the radial meshes.
=H2 Restore 
This function reloads all data from the files. 
(All previous editing discarded.)  
=H2 Recreate 
This function recreates U<=.in> (all data except symmetry definition and 
basis) and thus the default data. (All previous editing discarded.)  
It is usefull for automatic input creation via U<fedit -pipe>.
To avoid unwanted input file states, the first action in pipemode
may be B<Recreate> to get the default settings.
=H2 Core-occupation
For some sort of calculations set here the core occupation numbers. 
(4f states)
=H2 Initial-spinsplit
Define the initial symmetry breaking between spin sorts.
=H2 Iteration
Control version and settings for the iteration process.
=H2 Brillouin-zone
Control k-Integration internals.
=H2 Numerics
This submenu contains data, controling the numerics of the various 
subroutines of the code. 
=H2 Vatom
This menu controls the definition of the spherically averaged crystal 
potential, used in determinig the orbitals.
 
=H1 GENERAL DATA 
 
 
=H2 Spin sorts 
B<2>= spin polarized calculation, B<1>= unpolarized 
=H2 Initial polarization 
if B<t>, an initial symmetry breaking between the two spin 
sorts is applied. The amount  of splitting is given in alt. submenu 
B<Initial spinsplit>
=H2 K-mesh subdivision 
A vector of 3 integers: gives the subdivision of the Brillouin 
zone along the 3 axis from which the k-space integration mesh is
constructed.
=H2 occupied bands 
This is the number of occupied valence bands. It is usually smaller
than the number of valence states and a bit larger than  half 
the number of valence electrons (depending on the nature of the 
compound).
The default is -1 which allways works.
If memory use shall be lowered try to decrease this value to a little
more than half the number of valence electrons (take care).
=H2 Number of iterat. 
Maximum number of iteration steps. If no convergency is obtained, the
calculation will stop after this number of steps.
If this value is B<1>, the program will stop after one cycle
without overwriting the files U<=.dens> and U<=.basis>.
=H2 Accuracy of iteration 
Stop iteration, if convergency parameter below this value .
=H2 Total energy calc. 
If B<t>: calculate the total energy .
This takes some time. One can perform the iteration without total 
energy calc. and restart the converged calculation with this option 
to obtain etot.
=H2 Leave if deviation <. 
If B<Total energ calc.> = B<t>, the iteration will stop, 
if the deviation of the total energy over the last steps 
is less than this value. 
It takes at least 2 iteration cycles for this criterion to become
active. A maximum of 5 cycles is considered in calculating the total 
energy convergence condition. 
=H2 Convergence condition
Decide here, what you will consider a converged calculation.
If density and or energy criterion is fulfilled this logical 
function takes the final decision.
The default is density only, which means energy convergence is ignored.
For most applications this completely correct, since energy
converges faster than density.
=H2 options 
Activates the B<OPTIONS> menu. 
=H2 Fourier-comp of Ewald 
The number of Fourier components per site, used in the Ewald 
construction of the Coulomb potential. 
The default is a negative value (-500). 

There are two modes:

Automatic mode
=H+ 
B<A negative or zero value indicates that the code automatically>
B<determines the optimal Ewald screening parameter and the Fourier>
B<components.>
=H-
Manual mode
=H+ 
A positive value sets the number of Fourier components per site by 
hand. This number is multiplied with the number of lattice sites to
obtain the total number of components. In case of CPA the number of
crystallographic (real) sites is used, not the number of atoms per 
unit cell. Be reminded that in CPA there may be more than one atom 
at the same real site.

In manual mode the number of Fourier components must be converged by 
hand. In some cases this number  must be  enhanced remarkably.
Such cases were found to be i.e. very low dimensional systems.
=H-
=H2 Relativistic 
Select  box: non relativistic, scalar relativistic or full relativistic 
LSDA. 
The full relativistic mode is an implementation of the full 4-component
KOHN-SHAM-DIRAC theory (There is no second variation or similar 
approximations). It includes spin-orbit coupling and magnetic 
anisotropy. 
=H2 Vxc-potential 
Activates a select box for the typ of the exchange and correlation 
potential. 
=H2 fixed spin mom. 
True, if fixed spin moment calculation should be performed.
=H2 spin moment 
The value of the moment to be fixed via FSM. 

=H1 RELATIVISTIC SETTINGS

Here are the settings for the full relativistic mode.

=H2 Spin population analysis
Select  box: There are three different levels of accuracy of the
spin population analysis. The higher the level, the more time and
memory is used. The lowest level corresponds to the non relativistic
effort.
The spin occupation numbers in the output (Population analysis)
depend on this setting. So, one should check the influence of the
approximationon on this numbers, especially if these numbers are
taken for physical interpretations. 
=H2 Quantization axis
For the full-relativistic magnetic case, the magnetization direction
is specified via this vector. The energy depends on this direction due
to spin-orbit coupling (magnetic anisotropy).

=H1 OTHERS 
 
These data are not well classified in the moment, nevertheless 
they are placed here. 
 
=H2  Verbosity level 
A select box defining the chatyness of the code.

 
=H1 Files 
 
B<fplo>/B<fedit> needs several input files. 
The main idea behind B<fedit> is, that B<fplo> is the master and
knows everything about its files and about their content and 
semantics.
B<fedit> is the slave of B<fplo>. It is telled how to work by 
B<fplo>, using communication files.
 
=H2 Control files 

U<+tmp/> temporary directory for B<fedit>. 

U<+fedit,+tmp/+fedit> contains the screen control for fedit.
It must be present in both directories.
This file is allways deleted on B<fedit> startup. Then B<fplo> 
is called by B<fedit>, to create U<+fedit>. If B<fplo> failes, 
B<fedit> will not find U<+fedit> and will abort with error message. 
In such cases U<+fedit> may be visible before B<fedit> was called. 
The recreation process will delete it under assumption that B<fplo>
will successfully run. Please check the PATH variable to the B<fplo>
executable or just call fplo from command line, to see if it runs.

U<+fedithelp> contains the help screens. It is allways recreated on
every invocation of B<fedit> (by a call to B<fplo>).

Both files may be deleted at any time, they just control the 
comunication between B<fedit> and B<fplo>.

=H2 Data files

U<=.sym> contains the symmetry definitions. It is the master file.
From this file all other input files are calculated/recreated.
The recreation process takes place, if the status flag in U<=.sym>
says so. This is normally set by B<fedit> before structure update
(in B<SYMMETRY MENU>).
If the status is "ready" and all other data files or correct,
the data of U<=.sym> are not used in B<fplo> run, allthough the data are 
read. So U<=.sym> must be present and correct even in a normal B<fplo>
run.

U<=.in> contains all informations for the B<fplo> calculation,
including the symmetry information, which was copied from U<=.sym>.
(Exception U<=.basis>)
The normal B<fplo> run takes the symmetry settings from U<=.in>.
Only a symmetry-update-run takes U<=.sym>. The comparision of the 
symmetry data of both files will decide about, how data of U<=.in>
are reset to default values. After a file-update-run B<fplo>
will inform about which data where reset. 
PLEASE OBSERVE THESE MESSAGES.
B<fplo> will keep as many data as possible on every update.

Important:
If a default U<=.in> shall be created, the file has to be deleted 
first.


U<=.basis> contains informations about the basis orbitals.
This consists of to parts: the set of orbitals for every atom and
the compression parameter (x0) for the confining potential of
the valence orbitals.
These x0-parameter are input to B<fplo> on every start.

In non optimizing mode, they are the fixed compression parameter
for the whole calculation.

In basis optimization mode (option B<BASIS_OPTIMIZATION>), the values are
read in on startup and are written back after every iteration cycle.
So U<=.basis> will be updated eventually while B<fplo> runs!!
If you try to save this file from B<fedit>, (and if your file system
works correctly) you get a warning if the file was updated meanwhile.
Its best practice not to save U<=.basis> while B<fplo> is running.

The auto optimization mode produces self-consistent sets of densities
and x0. So, a successful restart of B<fplo> continuing where it left
is possible only, if the density and x0 from the last iteration step
may be retrieved. That's why U<=.basis> is updated on every iteration
cycle.


=H2 Internals 
The input files are organized using a C-like code. The data are 
structured with the help of syntactical rules.

B<fedit> and B<fplo> call a parser to read the data. This makes
the data handling between both programms easier. However, if the user
wants to change the files by hand, he has to observe the syntax,
otherwise the parser will return with an error. The syntax is
not to complicated, so the user will understand it soon.
Nevertheless, hand made changes on the files are strongly discouraged
as well as changes performed by shell scripts. For automatization
there is a special B<fedit> mode called pipe-mode. It interprets
simple input files containing hotkey-data pairs. With the help of
this  tool one can write shell scripts which automatically 
create B<fplo> input whithout messing around with the syntax/parser.

There are examples of such scripts in the distribution.


=H2 Saving and backup-files 
The three input files may be edited by B<fedit>. The changes are 
saved on exit from B<MAIN MENU>. All file handling in between, like
structure updates and similar things are performed in the 
temporay directory U<+tmp>.
Exception: 
A B<fedit> start in an empty directory (no input files) will call 
B<fplo> in the current working directory to create a default set
of input files.
On every B<fedit> start all files are copied onto backup files.

If the function B<Restore> is used, the content of the files is reloaded
into the screens.


=H1 Error messages 
 
=H2 Status line errors. 
If the editing of a field is not correct, a message is displayed. 
Than the editing goes on. Correct the value or use ESC-ESC,  to
discard changes.

=H2 Tests 
Before some action takes place, various data validity tests are 
performed. 
If errors occur, they will be displayed in a seperate screen. Please 
correct the  data and go on. You cannot save invalid data!

=H2 Parser errors.
If the syntax in U<+fedit> or in the input files is corrupted,
a error message is diplayed before B<fedit> will abort. The message
will say where the error occured. Depending on the nature of the error
you will find the file name in the page header or in the error message
itself. Normally there should be no parser errors. 
Possible reason:
The file version changed as well as the file content.
If one now uses old files with hand made version number updates, the
parser will not find the new data. Please use the converter tools
for version updates.

=H2 Serious errors 
If some serious errors occur, which the author hopes not to be the 
case, the program will abort. For instance a file (temorary file) 
is not found. Recompile and reinstall the tool or clean the U</tmp>. 
In cases of internal errors please send a report.

M<NUMERICS> 
 
B<NUMERICS> 
 
This menu contains settings, which control the numerics of the subroutines 
of B<fplo>. 
 
=H1 General remarks 
 
Here, the settings for the numeric subroutines are displayed. 
The most data should be OK with their default values. 
However, there are cases when the numerical accuracy should be enhanced.
 
=H1 Menu bar 
 
The menu bar contains the following entries 
 
=H2 exit 
Exit to the B<MAIN MENU>. 
=H2 help 
this page 
 
=H1 XC-POTENTIAL 
 
Here are the settings for the calculations of the local xc-potential 
contributions. 
=H2 radial mesh points 
Number of mesh points for numerical integration. 
=H2 degree of interpolat.
Number of points, used for the interpolation of the off center
contributions. 
=H2 angular mesh 
Type of angular mesh for numerical integration. B<13> is the finest mesh 
for the moment. 
=H2 use symmetry 
Use crystal symmetry for the calculations, this saves a lot of time. 
=H2 rotate 
Is for test reasons only. Should be B<t>. 
 
=H1 EWALD-POTENTIAL 

See B<XC-POTENTIAL>

=H1 AVERAGED CRYSTAL-POTENTIAL 
 
For the orbital calculation the spherically averaged crystal-potential 
is needed. This is done half-analytically. A 2-D numerical integration 
has to be performed. 
 
=H2 radial mesh points 
Number of radial mesh points for integration. 
=H2 azimutal mesh points 
Number of azimutal mesh points for integration. 
 
=H1 TWO CENTER INTEGRALS 

The orbital integrals are calculated in different ways. 
The kinetic terms, the overlap terms and the Hamiltonian elements 
with the spherical potential contributions are done in the subroutine 
U<twocenterint::calc_tcis> with bipolar coordinates, 
half-analyticlly (2-D numerical integration). 
 
=H2 xi-mesh points 
number of points for the hyperbolic coordinate 
=H2 eta-mesh points 
number of points for the ellyptical coordinate 

=H1 CRYSTAL FIELD INTEGRALS 

The crystal field contributions to the one-center terms and the 
two-center terms with the nonspherical potential contributions are done 
in U<cryfldint::calc_tc_cryfld_is> again on a bibpolar 2-D mesh. 
 
=H2 xi-mesh points 
number of points for the hyperbolic coordinate 
=H2 eta-mesh points 
number of points for the ellyptical coordinate 

=H1 ONE CENTER INTEGRALS 

The one-center terms are done half-analytically, on a 1D-mesh 
 
=H2radial mesh point 
number of radial mesh points for the numerical intagration 

=H1 THREE CENTER INTEGRALS 

The three-center integrals are done fully numerically. 
 
=H2 radial mesh point 
Number of radial mesh points for the numerical integration. 
This number hopefully may be reduced to B<25> without too much loss 
of accuracy. This would saves time. 
The angular integration is fixed to a particular scheme. 
 
=H1 COULOMB ENERGY CALCULATION 
 
The integral of density times potential is done like the two center terms 

=H2 xi-mesh points 
number of points for the hyperbolic coordinate 
=H2 eta-mesh points 
number of points for the ellyptical coordinate 

=H1 XC ENERGY CALCULATION 

The exchange and correlation energy (LSDA) is done like the 
xc-potential. The settings here should be the same as for the 
xc-potential. In some cases we remarked numerical noice in the
total energy versus lattice constant.
In this cases it helped to increase the XC,EXC radial mesh point 
parameter.
 
=H2 radial mesh points 
Number of mesh points for numerical integration. 
=H2 degree of interpolat.
Number of points, used for interpolation of off center terms. 
=H2 angular mesh 
Type of angular mesh for numerical integration. B<13> is the finest mesh 
for the moment. 
=H2 use symmetry 
Use crystal symmetry for the calculations, this saves a lot of time. 
 
=H1 OVERLAP DENSITY CALCULATION
 
The overlap density is calculated on a radial grid in polar coordinates
with a numerical 1D-integration (half analytically). 
Finally it is reinterpolated to the normal radial mesh.
 
=H2 radial mesh points 
number of radial mesh points for the radial grid to calculate on
=H2 azimutal mesh points 
number of azimutal mesh points for integration
 
=H1 CUT-OFF TOLERANCES
 
The extension of the radial functions is defined by testing their tails 
with the help of the following tolerances 
 
=H2 density 
for the local density contributions 
=H2 potential 
for the local contributions to the total potential 
=H2 orbitals 
for the core and valence basis orbitals 
 

=H1 INTERPOLATION OF RADIAL FUNCTIONS 

=H2 degree
This is the number of points used to perform the interpolation 
of the radial functions. I think B<8> is OK. 
More than 8 does not really increase accuracy.
 

=H1 SYMMETRY TEST

The symmetry test may be switched off (option B<NO_SYMMETRYTEST>).
If it is performed it tests various symmetrical properties of the
lattice functions. If the test failes, it may be a hint, that the 
input data are bad, or that the symmetry is wrong or that the 
numerical noice was great.

If the last is the case, use 

=H2 tolerance
to make a sloppier test.

=H1 CONFINING POTENTIAL

The valence basis orbitals are calculated, using a power law confining 
potential. The power usually is 4. For playing around we have the value
here.

=H2 Exponent
We performed many tests: 4 is the devine number in many cases!!!
However, there are exceptions :-(


=H1 RELATIVISTIC BASIS MAPPING

In the magnetic relativistic case, there are different radial functions
for every \mu-quantum number. There is no longer a degeneracy.
This leads to an enormous effort in the multi center integrals.
To make things easier and faster, the magnetic orbitals are mapped
onto pseudo-non relativistic symmetry. The resulting radial functions
within one nl-shell differ only slightly and may be fitted to a few fit
functions.
The fit is self approving, say it increases the number of fit functions
to achieve a minimum accuracy. However, the more fit functions are
used the slower is the code. Therefore, we give here some control
over the fit quality.

=H2 min No. of fit functs.
This is the minimum number of fit functions per nl-shell to be used. 
If for a certain orbital the fit is exact with less functions, 
then this setting is ignored.
=H2 max No. of fit functs.
This is maximum number of allowed fit functions. Even if the desired
accuracy is not achieved with this number of functions, the fit will
not further improve itself.
=H2 error tolerance
This is the required accuray of the fit. 
=H2 derivative fit wins
For the valence orbitals the derivative with respect to the confining 
potential has to fitted as well. Normally, the fit of the derivative is 
less accurate. The integration algorithms require the same number of 
fit functions for the orbitals and the derivatives. If this switch is
true then the derivative fit will determine the maximum number of
fit functions, otherwise the orbital fit itself will win.


=H1 EWALD CONTROL SETTINGS FIXED MODE

If the number of Fourier components for the Ewald construction is
chosen to be positive this indicates the manual choice of components.
In this case there is a dimensionless cutoff factor c, which determines
th Ewald screening parameter p via
=H+ p=c/(r_NN/2)
=H-
This parameter normally need not be changed. It is for debugging purposes
only.

=H1 EWALD CONTROL SETTINGS AUTOMATIC MODE

In automatic mode (negative or zero value of Fourier components) the Ewald
parameter and the number of Fourier components are determined automatically.
There are two tolerances, which determine acceptable cutoffs. 

=H2 Real space tolerance
This is the tolerance which determines the extend of the real space
Ewald compensation charge. This charge is a Gaussian type function and
the tolerance determines, how much of the tail is cut off at the 
maximum mesh radius.

=H2 Rec. space tolerance
This is the tolerance which determines the acceptable cut off of
the reciprocial space Ewald compensation charge. This charge is also
of Gaussian type. This tolerance determines, how much of the tail is 
cut  off at the maximum reciprocial lattice vector. This cut off
hence determines the number of Fourier components.




M<MESH DEFINITION> 
 
B<MESH DEFINITION> 

This menu controls the mesh generation for the crystal and orbital
calculation. 

=H1 General remarks 

The use of the shape function technique for the xc and ewald construction
and the automatic basis optimization  put restrictions on the extension 
of the meshes.
Normally B<fplo> will create automatic values for the maximum mesh 
extension, depending on the lattice stucture. It is possible to change
the settings here.
The minimum radius for the meshs may be to large for havy atoms!!!
Take 1.0e-6 for heavy atoms.

=H1 RADIAL FUNCTION MESH

This is the definition of the logarithmical radial mesh, used 
throughout the crystal code. 

=H2 number of mesh points
gives the number of points on this mesh 

=H2 minimal radius
gives the minimum value, at which the mesh starts. 

=H2 maximal radius
gives the maximum range of the mesh.  
0.0 means automatic choice.

=H2 factor for rmax
enhance the automatic rmax value by this factor. Its better to change 
this, than to change rmax, since the factor scheme will scale with 
lattice parameters.


=H1 ATOM MESH 
 
For the orbital calculation this logarithmic mesh is used. 
 
=H2 number of mesh points
This is the number of points on the mesh. 

=H2 minimal radius 
This is the minimum value, at which the mesh starts. 

=H2 maximal radius 
This is the maximum range of the mesh. The default value 0.0
ties it to the radial mesh above. 
The orbitals are calculated in a potential which jumps to infinity 
at rmax. This avoids a running away of the orbitals in auto optimizing
mode.


M<SHAPE FUNCTION> 
 
B<SHAPE FUNCTION> 
 
This menu serves to control the shape function creation. 
 
=H1 General remarks 
 
The shape function is created in the initial part of the B<fplo> 
run. It depends on the crystal structure including the 
lattice constants and Wyckhof positions. 
The calculated shape function is written in a rather lattice constant
independend and Wyckhoff-position independend format into the file
U<+voronoi>. In principle, its possible to run B<fplo> without
recreating U<+voronoi>. Then, the file is read.
In general its best practice to calculate the shape function on every 
B<fplo>-run. 
The creation of the shape function is controled by B<build shape>. 

#B<IMPORTANT NOTE:>
#The standard voronoi cell is the smallest possible cell definition.
#That means, it contains only as many planes as nesseccary to define the
#compact support of the cell. However, there are cases where the variation
#of some lattice parameter (i.e. a Wyckoff position) is changing the
#geometrical relations (ratio of next neighbor distances).
#In this case it may be nesseccary to increase the set of planes defining the 
#voronoi shape function. 
#This is done by, first creating all cells for all different
#geometries, present in the parameter range to be calculated and 
#second to form the union of all cells. This union may be stored in a file,
#which then may be used in all calculations.

#The merged file may be given a name different from  U<+voronoi> .
#Then the B<voronoi file> specified in this menu will be used instead.


#This is the main reason for the switch B<build>.
#The union can be formed using the B<Perl>-script U<MERGEVORONOI>
#in the U<FPLO/bin> directory.

#Unfortunatly, there are cases, when the merging will fail. This happens,
#if the different geometries lead to a different atom order in the
#symmetry calculation routines, which can not be controled at present.

#We hope, you will never encounter such a situation.
 
=H1 Problems 
 
There may occur numerical noice, which results in various error 
messages. In the Voronoi-shape case, an 'DINV33: zero determinant' 
error or an 'volume' error may occur. Try to increase the 
B<Arithmetic tolerance> in the submenu B<voronoi cell>. 
If this does not help, change the symmetry input (e.g. lattice \
constants) by a tiny ammount, which is unimportant for the situation
condidered.

=H1 CREATION CONTROL

=H2 Build shape
If this switch is 't', the next B<fplo>-run will create a new
U<+voronoi>. If false, the file specified in B<voronoi file> 
will be read. Normally  't' is the correct/best choice. 
#Only, if cell merging is used, 'f' is the appropriate choice, 
#to force the input of the merged B<voronoi file>.
=H2 Voronoi file
The file from which to read the voronoi cell data, if build is 'f'.

=H1 GEOMETRY AND FORM 
 
This section gives the switches for the general layout of the 
shape functions. 
In principle, the form of the shape function is unimportant.
However, the potential is represented as a finite angular momentum 
series. Thus, the form of the shape function is important.
It should be rather smooth.

 
=H2 Siffness of shape 
This number is the iteration depth of the recursive insertion of the 
elementar shape profil. The higher this number the steeper the 
function. Infinity (or > 100) would give the step function, 
becoming zero at the middle of distance central atom --  cell
boundary.
2 should be a good choice. 
=H2 Profil of the shape function 
This determins the type of the elementar function, whose iterative 
insertion gives steeper and steeper shape functions.
We implemented the cosine type and the Becke type.
We recommend the cosine type.


=H1 TEST OPTIONS 
 
These data control the testing of the shape function.
The tests will be performed, when running the B<fplo> program, 
 
=H2 Test shape 
If 't' some tests on the shape function will be performed. 
Two files are created U<+unity> and U<+dirsh>. The files are explaind 
below. 
=H2 Let it go if deviation less than
This is the tolerance for comparing with zero. It decides wether the 
tests are correct or not. This number may be to small, but 
nevertheless it should be a tiny number. 
=H2 Mesh points for tests 
It gives the number of radial mesh-points for the tests. All tests 
are done on a radial mesh along a certain direction, see below. 
This number only determines the quality of the final pictures 
in U<+dirsh>. 
=H2 number of directions 
This defines the total number of lines along which the tests are 
performed. 
=H2 1,2,... 
A test-line is defined by a starting point, a direction and a length. 
B<site> is the number of the atom in the unit cell (not Wyckhoff position) 
where the line starts. 
B<vector> gives the direction of the line. 
B<distance> gives the length of the line .
You can start editing the lines by typing the number, marked as 
hotkey. If you want to add or delete lines, you have to change the 
B<number of directions>. 
 

=H1 Files

=H2 +dirsh 
Contains the shape function along the lines specified in B<TEST OPTIONS>. 
This file has two columns, r and f(r), the data sets for different 
test-lines are separated by empty lines. This shape functions should be  
smooth and monoton functions, falling off to zero at the next neighbour, 
if the line, along which it is callculated, is crossing a next neighbour
site.  It is zero outside the voronoi cell.
=H2 +unity 
Contains the difference between the lattice sum of all shape functions 
and unity. It should contain really tiny numbers, say zeros. At least 
in the region near the specified sites this should be the case. 
If the unity condition is violated far away from the atom, say U<+unity> 
does not contain zeros, the internal lattice sum was not complete. 

The file has three columns, The first is an continous index, the 
second contains the 'zeros' and the third must be equal to the second, 
otherwise the CPA treatment has a problem. The different test-lines are 
concatenated together in this file. 
If the B<mesh-points for test> are 30, the second line starts at 
index 60 and so on. 
 



M<VORONOI CELL> 
 
B<VORONOI CELL> 
 
This menu controls the creation of the voronoi cells 
 
=H1 General remarks 
 
The voronoi-cell shape construction should work more or less 
automatically. The final result in the B<fplo> output may not 
easily be tested. 
The B<fplo> run outputs PostScript pictures containing the voronoi cells.
The voronoi cell for a given atom is defined in the following: 
Construct for each other atom in the lattice a plane, containing this 
atom, and being perpendicular to the line connecting both atoms. 
Then the voronoi cell is the inner region of all those planes. 
Planes belonging to the cell boundary are those having more than 
points or lines in common with the boundary. These planes are determined 
when calulating the voronoi cell. 
 
 
=H1 NEIGHBOUR ATOMS TO TEST 
 
These are the control entries for the search of the cell boundary 
 
=H2 Cut-off radius 
Search for neighbours up to this distance around the actual atom. 
The larger this value the slower the code. 
If it is to small some planes are not found.
=H2 number off neighbours 
A second limiting value for set of planes to search in. 
All neighbours are sorted by distance. Than this number is the 
maximum number of neighbouring atoms or planes to search in 
=H2 arythmetic tolerance 
This tolerance is a difficult thing. It defines when two atoms or planes 
are equivalent. Since some numerical noise is always present, it 
should not be to small. 
 
=H1 TEST-OUTPUT 
 
If some informations are needed about which planes ar chosen, this 
controls the output. 
 
=H2 detials of search 
If true, the calculated planes are printed out, together with their 
distance from the atom and with the number of corners, which this 
plane has in common with the cell boundary. 
Additionally, all corners of the voronoi cell are printed out together 
with their distance from the atom. 
Finally the minimum and maximum distance of all corners and planes 
are given. 
=H2 print up to neighbour 
If this number is zero, nothing more is done. 
If it is positive, a lot of information while searching the planes 
is printed, up to the plane-number given in this entry. 
This is usefull only if one knows the code 
=H2 only print neighbour 
If this number is zero, nothing more is done. 
If it is positive, a lot of information while searching the planes 
is printed out only for the plane-number given in this entry. 
This is usefull only if one knows the code 
If both numbers above are given, the union of both is done: 
If B<print up to neighb.>=3 and B<only print neighb.>=10 than 
for the planes 1,2,3 and 10 the information is printed. 
 
 



M<CPA> 
 
B<CPA MENU> 
 
This submenu contains the control for the CPA-calculations. 
 
=H1 General remarks 
 
This menu is used to set all data necessary for a CPA calculation. 
The CPA step consists of two iteration loops, the CPA loop 
and the Fermi-energy loop. 

=H1 Important notes

The self energy integration path has to be specified in this menu.
The path is defined by a lower and an upper energy bound. 
First, the path must be defined such, that the band bottom and the fermi
energy are both within this energy interval.
(In many cases the default settings should be sufficient.)
Second, the Interval should not be to large, especially, the
band bottom should not be far above the lower bound. Otherwise,
the integration is integrating zeros and accuracy is lost.
Be aware, that the semi core states are far below the valence band
bottom, therefore the lower bound is that deep in semi-core calculations.
Both numbers are specified in Hartree.
You have to experiment, to find the proper values in case a warning occurs.

=H1 CONCENTRATION 
 
For each Wyckoff position there may be more than one atom in the CPA 
case. Here you give the concentration for each atom. The sum of 
concentrations of all atoms at one position must be unity. The 
concentrations must not be zero. If you need zero, remove the atom 
from the structure. 


=H1 DENSITY OF STATES, BLOCH SPECTRAL DENSITY
 
=H2 number of e-points
The number of energy points between the B<lower energy bound> and
the B<upper energy bound> ( defined in B<BANDPLOT MENU>).
=H2 imag(e)
The imaginary part of the energy.
The smaller the value the sharper the curves. But
there is a limit. The equal weight sampling in the reciprocial cell
(k-integration) must be extremely refined if imag(e) is to small !!
It needs some playing, to get good pictures.

#=H1 BLOCH SPECTRAL DENSITY
#
#See above. (Not yet implemented)
#
=H1 SELF ENERGY ITERATION 
 
This controls the inner CPA iteration loop for the calculation of the 
self energy. 
 
=H2 Lower energy bound 
The lower energy bound for the integration path in the complex 
upper half plane. This value must be below the band bottom.
See related warnings.
=H2 Upper energy bound 
The upper energy bound for the integration path in the complex 
upper half plane. This value must be above the fermi energy. 
=H2 Imaginary part at e_F
(in Hartree)
The imaginary part of the energy at the Fermi energy.
The smaller the value the more accurate are the results. But
there is a limit. The equal weight sampling in the reciprocial cell
(k-integration) must be extremely refined if imag(e_F) is to small !!
There is a tradeoff between calculation time and accuracy.
Especially, if the CPA loop does permanently not converge or if
it takes many steps to converge it (in particular around the Fermi energy)
then it may be wise to sacrifice accuracy. 
IMPORTANT: for a set of calculations this number must be the same
throughout all calculations, otherwise comparison of the results is
senseless!
=H2 Number of E-points 
Number of energy points on the semi circular integration path. 
30 should be enough in many cases, since all functions are very 
smooth in the upper half plane. 
=H2 CPA loops maximum 
Maximum number of inner CPA loops (determination of the self energy). 
If the self energy is not converging this number is killing the 
infinit repetition of the sensless iterations. 
10 is a good number. Often, the iteration speeds up remarkably
while the density iteration goes on.
 
=H1 FERMI ENERGY ITERATION 
 
This controls the iteration loops of the fermi energy, which encloses 
the inner CPA-loop. The CPA is much more accurate and much faster, 
if using the semi circular path. But than the Fermi energy has to be 
determined iteratively. 
 
=H2 Guess of fermi energy 
This is nothing than the first guess of the  Fermi energy in the 
very first step. 
=H2 Maximum of e-fermi loops 
This prohibits infinit loops, if it does not converge. 
If the Fermi energy does not converge the lacking number of electrons
may spoil heavily the SCF-iteration.
Try to increase this number, if no convergency is obtained.
Sometimes the problem vanishes in the next charge self-consistency 
cycle. 
In cases of insulators a different method of e-fermi iteration may be 
used. This  method is nearly fail-save but slow, so this number   
must be 30 or more!
=H2 First sloop 
The secant method to converge the Fermi energy starts with a 
tangent method. This number is the sloop of this first tangent step. 
It is somthing like the density of states at the actual fermi energy. 
The smaller the more changes in the Fermi energy. 
=H2 Smallest slope 
This is an lower bound for the sloop of the secant method. It prohibits 
huge changes in the Fermi energy. 
=H2 Iteration method 
How to search Fermi energy. 
Secant method: best method, fastest, for metalls, can fail
Bisection method: (very) slow but save, for insulators

The special k-points: 
First, the label  (used by U<fedit -bandplot> see fplo documentation)
Second, a vector defining the k-point. The  units are 2Pi/a. 
If a k-vector has cartesian coordinates 
=H+ B<k>=(2Pi/a kx,2Pi/b ky,2Pi/c kz)
=H- then it must be given as 
=H+ U<B<k>>=(kx,a/b ky,a/c kz) 
=H- here. 

B<REMARK 1:>
If you specified your own points here, be aware, that a change in the 
lattice constants or in the symmetry group, will reset the points to
their default values, due to the dependency of the k-points on
the lattice scaling (especially for lower symemtric groups.)

B<REMARK 2:>
If one needs the Bloch spectral density or bandstructure at special
k-points (i.e. for calculating Fermi surfaces) it is possible
to overwrite the settings here by creating a file U<=.kp>.

M<ITERATION CONTROL> 
 
B<ITERATION CONTROL> 
 
This submenu contains the details to control the iteration procedure.
 
=H1 General remarks 
 
There are three possibilities to perform the iteration, 
"Simple mix", "Iterat" and "Iterat with linear progress control".
Simple mix is the simplest scheme, where some percent of the new
solution are mixed into the old solution to get a new start density.
Usually it is stable, but very slow.

Iterat is a heuristic scheme, which uses the iteration history
to predict the "best" new density. This scheme is very fast.
In some cases it may run into troubles, then a random step is
made, to get out of a closed cycle.

Normaly, one would use Iterat.

The Iterat with linear progress control is a newer idea, 
which may fail in rare cases. It is not yet tested enough. However, 
the main idea behind it, is to force the iteration progress in some 
circumstances where iterat will make a bad choice. So, if iterat does
jump around and it is not due to level crossing (tetrahedron method), 
try this one.

=H2 Mixing 
"Simple mix": gives the amount of mixing of the new solution 
vector into the previous solution vector.
"Iterat ...": gives the amount by which the subspace interpolation 
is used, this is only the starting and maximum value of mixing, 
the internally used value is calculated from interpolation history. 
=H2 Max subspace dim
Only "Iterat ..."
The new solution vector is calculated using a linear 
interpolation within the subspace spanned by the last 
solution vectors. This number limits the maximal allowed 
dimension of this space.
=H2 Progress control
This number controls the nonlinearities of the interpolation.
The smaller this value the longer will the dimensionalty of
the present subspace retained. 


=H1 ITERATION VECTOR RATIO

At present, there may be three sorts of values contained in the iteration
vector. The occupation matrix (LSDA+U), the density and in auto optimizing
mode additionally the compression parameter.

=H2 x0 / density
This gives the ratio between the x0 and the density , when put into
the iteration vector. The smaller this value, the less progress is
made for the x0 part of the iteration vector.
In other words, if heavy changes of x0 spoil the density iteration
this number should be decreased.

=H2 occu mat / density
This gives the ratio between the occupation matrix and the density , 
when put into the iteration vector. The smaller this value, the less
progress is made for the LSDA+U part of the iteration vector.
In other words, if heavy changes of the occupation matrix spoil the
density iteration this number should be decreased.

M<SYMMETRY MENU> 
 
B<SYMMETRY MENU> 
 
This menu serves to define the symmetry and to construct the main input
file U<=.in> and U<=.basis> .
 
 
=H1 General remarks 
 
The symmetry file U<=.sym> contains all settings defining the 
crystal symmetry  and the approximations to the full potential.
From this settings the input files are calculated. In this process
the data containted in the input files will be retained, except
the symmetry changes will force a change in the data dimension
or in the data interdependencies. 
 
If a new structure shall be calculated or if the lattice constant or 
the maximum number of angular momenta shall be changed the input files
U<=.in> and U<=.basis> have to be updated using the update function 
of this menu. 
 
=H1 Menu bar 
 
The menu bar contains the following entries

Exit the menu. 
If some changes where made in the menu data without updating the 
files, B<fedit> will warn, that the changes will take place after
update only.
=H2 Extern edit (Expert mode)
It calls an external editor to edit the U<=.sum> file directly. 
The external editor may be set by a command line option. 
Please, take care and meet the proper syntax rules for the
input files.
=H2 Update
This runs B<fplo> to recreate the input files U<=.in> and U<=.basis>. 
Afterwards the output is shown in a viewer. 
If some data had to be reset to default values, due to symmetry
changes, it will be shown in the output. Please, have a look on it.

The number and symbol of the space group of the lattice.
=H2 Unit of length
The unit of the lattice constants:
Bohr radii or Angstrom. 
=H2 Lattice constants 
A vector containing the lattice constants. 
=H2 Axis angles 
A vector containing the angles between the axis. 
(See B<fplo>-documentation.) 
=H2 Maximum L 
The maximum angular momentum used in the angular momentum expansion 
of all real space functions (density, potential). 
=H2 Number of atoms 
The number of Wyckoff positions in the unit cell. 
=H2 1,2,.. 
The Wyckoff positions. First the element name second the vector in 
the unit cell. The vector may contain fractional numbers. This is
nice for hexagonal latices (i.e. hcp is group 194 with one Wyckoff
position: 1/3 2/3 1/4.)
If one needs to remove an atom, either edit it in the external editor, 
or change the B<number of atoms>. If one uses the external editor 
one has to change the variable nsort and wyckhoff_positions.

=H2 X0_LOOP
Debuggin option!
This option allows to vary the x0-parameter for fixed potential.
The calculation starts with calculating the potential from the density
and then performs an endless loop in which the Kohn-Sham equation
for this potential is solved and the x0-parameters are optimized.
So, the only thing which changes from step to step are the x0's.
There is no print out of the loop-counter. The calculation has
to be interrupted by hand to stop!!! The variation of the
x0's for a fixed density/potential NEED NOT be reasonable, since
a change in the basis can create drastic potential changes, which
are not accounted for if the potential is fixed.





M<BASIS DEFINITION>

B<BASIS DEFINITION>

=H1 General remarks 

The file U<=.basis> serves, to define the basis states for the crystal
calculation. It containts the state definitions and the compression
parameters x0 for the valence state confining potential.
In auto optimizing mode, the x0 are changed by B<fplo> in every iteration
cycle. So, its best not to touch this submenu, while the calculation
is running.

=H1 BASIS AND COMPRESSION 

 
This fields contain the information about the basis set and 
the compression parameter for each atomic sort (Wyckoff-position). 
The two editable fields are activated by the corresponding number. 
Both fields are activated one after the other. 
 
=H2 BASIS field 
A basis definition looks like
=H+
1s:: 2s2p / 3s3p3d + 4d 
=H1
The first part before the colon are the cores orbitals.
Between :: and / are the semi core orbitals.
Between / and + are the valence orbitals.
After + are the polarization orbitals.

The core orbitals do NOT have a compression parameter. All
other orbitals have one. The parameters for semi core and polarization
orbitals are allways negativ (fixed). If you type a positive
value it will be corrected. So, the only free orbitals are
the valence orbitals between / and +.



The editing of this field works as follows: 
The core-marker may be shifted to the cursor position by typing ':' or 
SPACE. The same holds for the semi-core marker '/'  and for the 
polarization marker '+'. If a marker is placed into another section
the other markers are adjusted as well. (Example: move cursor
into the core section and type '+'. Now everything left of the cursor
still is core, but everything which was right of the cursor is now
polarization orbitals, while the semi-core and valence section are empty.)

Orbitals in all but the core-section may be deleted by one of the 
delete keys. The markers and the core states may not be deleted. 
(If you need to delete a core-orbital, move the core-marker ':' such
that it becomes a non-core orbital, then you can delete it.)

In the non-core sections of the field you can add a state, by typing
the main quantum number say a digit followed by the angular momentum 
s, p, d or f. The non-core sections together must contain at least 
one orbital. There must not be any two identical states in the whole field. 
After leaving the field 
1. the corresponding compression parameter are adjusted in number 
and order, according to the changes made. 
2. the editing continues with the compression field.


B<Grouping>:
One may define groups of orbitals. All orbitals of a group have the 
same compression parameter. This reduces the number of variational
parameters and may stabilize the calculation. However, some
experience has to be gathered before doing extensive grouping.

If the cursor is before at least a pair of orbitals one may created a 
grouped pair by typing '('. Any group may be enlarged by typing 
'(' before it or ')' after it. 

Example 1
=H+ You have
=H+ 2s2p(3s3p)3d
=H- Move cursor to the 2s orbital and type '(', you get
another group
=H+ (2s2p)(3s3p)3d
=H-
=H-
Example 2
=H+ You have
=H+ 2s2p(3s3p)3d
=H- Move cursor to the 2p orbital and type '(', you get
a larger group
=H+ 2s(2p3s3p)3d
=H-
=H-
Example 3
=H+ You have
=H+ (2s2p)3s3p3d
=H- Move behind to the 3d orbital and type ')', you get
a group of five orbitals
=H+ (2s2p3s3p3d)
=H-
=H-
Any group may be made shorter by typing one of the parenthese
inside the group. 

Example 4
=H+ You have:
=H+ (2s2p3s3p3d)
=H- Move cursor to 3p and type '(', you get
=H+ 2s2p3s(3p3d)
=H-
=H-
Example 5
=H+ You have:
=H+ (2s2p3s3p)3d
=H- Move cursor to 3s and type ')', you get
=H+ (2s2p)3s3p3d
=H-
=H-

If any of the group edit actions would create a group of 1 orbital,
the group (parentheses) will disapear.


Example 6
=H+ You have:
=H+ (2s2p3s3p)3d
=H- Move cursor to 3p and type '(', you get
=H+ 2s2p3s3p3d
=H-
=H-

The group markers may be deleted, thus ungrouping the corresponding 
orbitals.

B<Summary:>
=H+ '(' outside a group creates a grouped pair, if at least a pair of 
=H+ ungrouped orbitals is available at the cursor
=H-
=H-
=H+ '(' before a group adds one orbital to the group or creates
=H+ a new group (depends on the number of orbitals between cursor
position and group)

=H+ '(' inside a group shifts group begin to cursor position
=H-
=H+ ')' outside a group enlarges an existing group
=H-
=H+ ')' inside a group shifts the group end marker to the cursor position
=H-
=H+ Group markers may be deleted, resolving the group into individual
orbitals.

=H2 COMPRESSION field 
The number of parameters is determined by the number of non-core
orbitals/groups. Each parameter correspondes to a single orbital or to 
a group in the same order as they appear in the BASIS field. 

The semi-core and the polarization section refer to fixed
compression in the process of automatic x0-optimization. 
This is indicated by negative numbers. You may edit all compression
parameters, with any sign you want. After typing U<ENTER> the
proper sign is choosen automatically. So, you never need to care
about the sign, just about the classification.

There are two sections with fixed compression, just for convinience
and clarity (semi-core and polarization orbitals behave rather 
different).
However, at present there is no difference in the result, if orbitals 
are shifted between these two classes.

Normally you only need to specify the fixed values (semi-core and 
polarization section), since the other (valence section) are obtained 
by optimization.

Sometimes it is nesseccary to set proper start values for the
optimization in the valence section.


(A zero value is allowed and means no compression at all. This
however is no longer recommended.)



=H1 Command mode

There is the possibility to form equivalence classes of sorts.
All sorts (Wyckoff-positions) of a class share the same basis definition
and compression parameter. This is a usefull tool for cases, where
the atoms are extremly similar, but symmtrically inequivalent.
It just reduces the number of parameters which have to be optimized.
Only experienced users should use this!
Only chemically equivaleny sorts (same elements) may be collected in
classes.


You may type ':' (shown in the menu bar). Then a command line appears
at the bottom of the screen. There you may type two commands

=H2 Make equivalences

The first command is called B<eqm> and has to be followed by
a space-separated list of Wyckhoff or sort numbers. 

=H+ eqm sort1 sort2 ... sortn sort-target
=H-

It declares all these sorts to belong to the same equivalence class.
Practically it is a move command, which moves all but the last sorts 
of the list into the class of the last list element. 
The classes are displayed in a unique way. The 'hotkey'-sort is 
allways the smallest sort of a class. All other class members are 
displayed in the 'equivalences' line below the compression parameters.
For the B<eqm> command it does not matter, which of the class elements 
is given as the target, say it need not be the hotkey-sort. 
The main point is, that the basis definition of the target-sort 
(last list element) will be used for the newly created or enlarged 
class.

The sorts, which shall be moved, may be in any class.


=H2 Extract equivalences

The command

=H+ eqx sort1 sort2 ... sortn
=H-

extracts the given sorts from which class ever and makes them classes
by themselfs. 







M<SPHERICALLY AVERAGED CRYSTAL POTENTIAL> 
 
B<SPHERICALLY AVERAGED CRYSTAL POTENTIAL> 
 
This menu serves to control the creation of the spherically
averaged crystal potential (Vatom). 
 
=H1 General remarks 

The orbitals are calculated, using the spherical average of the 
crystal potential. For the core orbitals only this potential
is used, while for the valence orbitals the confining potential 
is added.

This potential must be as close to the true crystal potential
as possible in the core region (otherwise the core energies
are wrong). Therefore in the core region the true average is
used. In the outer (valence) region the true average is spiky
due to the 1/r-potential contributions of the neighbouring atoms.

There are many ways to continue the true average into the 
valence region, omitting the spikes. 
In all cases the radius, from which Vatom starts to deviate from
the average, is chosen to be the first maximum of the true average
 between 0 and the nearest neighbour.

In FPLO-1, Vatom stays constant at the maximum value. (This was option
U<OLD_VAT> in FPLO-2 menus).
In FPLO-2, Vatom is continued from the maximum position to the next 
neighbor radius using a cosine function in such a way that the value
at and after the next neighbor radius equals the averaged crystal
potential (full average, a constant).
In FPLO-3, we use a Gauss convolution of the true spherical average.
The convolution starts to be used at the maximum position and between
this point and a certain radial offset the convolution width is
switched on in a continous manner from zero up to a maximum width.
This gives a Vatom-definition, which is independent of geometrical
quantites like next neighbour distance. It is nesseccary for certain
applications and should be the default.

3) FPLO-3 (convoluted) (the new, geometry independend definition)

=H1 GAUSS CONVOLUTION PARAMTER 

Here the maximum width and the switch-on-length for the convolution 
version is defined.
These values are merly for debugging purposes. For actual calculations
the default values should be sufficient.

=H2 Width of Gauss function
This is the maximum half width or screening length of the Gauss
convolution.
=H2 Switch-on-length
This is the radial offset. Between maximum-position and
maximum-position+U<Switch-on-length> the Gauss width is increases
from 0 to U<Width of Gauss function>


M<LSDA+U> 
 
B<LSDA+U> 
 
This menu serves to control the LSDA+U calculations. 
 
=H1 General remarks 

There are various LSDA+U functionals around. We implemented some of them. 
You may specify the type of LSDA+U functional and the correlated states 
here. The parameters U,J (expressed through Slater parameters) are
external values. U<FPLO> does not calculate them!

 
=H1 Problems 

The iteration process may be spoiled heavily by LSDA+U. 
There are several reasons:
=H+ 1) The occupation matrix is changing to much.
See B<Occu. matrix tolerance> below!
=H-
=H+ 2) There are several magnetic solutions, depending on the values of
the occupation matrix elements. The iteration process may jump between
this solutions. In this case decrease the global iteration mixing in 
the B<ITERATION CONTROL> submenu!
=H-

The results of LSDA+U within U<FPLO> may remarkably deviate form other 
implementations. This is manly due to the fact, that the definition of
the correlated orbitals is rather arbitrary for different bandstructure
methods.

=H2 Functional
Opens a select box for the choice among various functionals.
=H2 Projection
In a nonorthogonal basis, there are several choices to define the
occupation matrix of the correlated states.



=H1 CORRELATED STATES 

Here the correlated states are defined. Each state is specified by a 
atom sort (Wyckoff-position) and by a state label (i.e. 3d).
The 4 Slater parameters F0-F6 define the Coulomb matrix elements.
F0 is identical with U. The other parameters specify J in the 
following manner:

=H2 s-states
=H+ J=0
=H2 p-states
=H+ J=F2/5
=H2 d-states
=H+ J=(F2+F4)/14
=H2 f-states
=H+ J=(286*F2+195*F4+250*F6)/6435
=H-
=H-

If the B<Number of definitions> is nozero and B<Make LSDA+U> is false,
no LSDA+U is done.
If the B<Number of definitions> is zero and B<Make LSDA+U> is true,
no LSDA+U is done.


=H1 ITERATION CONTROL

The occupation matrix is self consistently recalculated in every cycle.
In the first loops, starting from a non converged density, this matrix
may vary heavily from step to step. This may spoil the iteration process.

=H2 Occu. matrix tolerance
This tolerance controls the recalculation of the occupation matrix.
If the deviation of the new occupation matrix form the old
one is larger than this tolerance, it will be recalculated until
the tolerance is met.
This means, that the complete diagonalization step is reperformed 
until the deviations are small enough. For large systems, this may
lead to rather slow cycles in the beginning of the iteration!
